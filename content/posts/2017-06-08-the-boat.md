Excerpt: 

> His name is Paul or Peter, I forget. We sit together, squashed among a couple dozen others like the human luggage that we are, below the deck, where years of putrefying fish have left their stink. No windows. Someone's puked. An infant cries.

> I fold my arms and try to think of nothing, but he’s talking in my ear again. About a boat, not this one, not the filthy bucket that we’re crammed inside; a sailboat, one he used to own, his pride and joy, it seems—though he insists, it’s not a yacht.

A laugh begins to bubble up, or is it just a retch, the air is hot and thick.
