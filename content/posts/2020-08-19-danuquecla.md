Since 2001, I've been reading about the Copper and Bronze Ages of Europe, with a view to writing a work of fiction set sometime in that era. Over time, many of the specifics have changed: the time period, the location, the literary form, the characters, the story. I first conceived of it as a novel along the lines of J. H. Rosny _ainé_'s _Guerre de Feu_ or Jim Crace's _The Gift of Stones_. Currently, I'm working instead on a verse drama that will form part of a cycle, to which I've given the working title _Danuquécla_. It's possible that that may also change; the project continues.

This page is a catch-all for things I've written about this, my longest-running writing project, the one from which I've been distracted many times, but to which I keep returning. I'll keep this page updated with links to everything of mine that's published anywhere about the project. Eventually (hopefully) there will be some actual literary work, which I will announce here too.

## A journey down the Danube

In 2014, I travelled down the Danube, from Germany to Romania, and wrote [a series of posts](/2014/09/prehistoric-fiction/) about my travels for the literary journal _Southerly_'s blog.

## Archaic poetic metres

The same year, I also edited _New Trad_, [a volume of poems and essays on poetics](/2014/04/new-trad) by contributors from around the world; the theme was new work written in archaic metrical forms, most notably an excerpt from Beverliey Braune's epic poem _Skulvádi Úlfr_. (This wasn't consciously intended as part of my effort to set a work of fiction in prehistory, but it's turned out to be very pertinent.)

## Prehistory in fiction

In 2017, I started part-time research for a doctorate at the Writing & Society Research Centre, Western Sydney University. It's a hybrid, 'creative' doctorate: half my effort goes into writing a creative work, and the other half is on a separate but related exegesis. My topic is 'prehistory in fiction'.

To prepare for my confirmation of candidature, I recorded the slideshow and talk I gave to my supervisory panel, which described the direction I intended my research to take. The recording is [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHqM6NR_Na8), though it's pretty dry and I wouldn't recommend watching it, unless you happen to be as obssessed by this topic as I am.

Perhaps a bit more interesting is 'Ghosts and Grave Robbers', a [poster presentation](/media/gagr.pdf) I made which combines facts, photos and diagrams alongside a poem that dabbles in some of the formal experimentation I've been thinking about for the project as a whole.

## Fiction and archaeology

I wrote my first peer-reviewed article for the _Australian Humanities Review_, on [the interrelationship of archaeology and so-called 'prehistoric fiction'](/2019/11/isolt).

## An archaeological dig in Bulgaria

In 2019, I attended an archaeological dig near Pazardzhik, Bulgaria. I [wrote about the experience](/2020/05/mud) for the _Sydney Review of Books)_.

(That's all so far, but watch this space.)
