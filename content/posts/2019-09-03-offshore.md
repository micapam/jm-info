In the near future, Sydney is collapsing into chaos. The internet disappears, the water isn't running and the electricity goes out. An academic and a medical student try to smuggle themselves out of the country. But when their boat gets stopped, they are interned on an island detention centre somewhere in the Indian Ocean...

> 'Mostafa writes with a fine command of rhythm and pace, and the book builds an escalating sense of panic as the mental toll of being a refugee is laid bare. Its social critique is more lucid, and more barbed, for the plausibility it brings to its portrayal of a future Australia consumed by chaos and calamity.' - Cameron Woodhead, _Sydney Morning Herald_.

> 'One of the reasons Joshua’s scenes are so compelling is that they could be set today, right now, and that they are set in the world – the Sydney, and the Blue Mountains – that we know....The way Joshua paces and interweaves these narratives, uses them to maintain suspense – the erotics of this text, if you like – is close to masterful.' - David Brooks, author of _The Fern Tattoo_ and _The Grass Library_.

> 'In the vein of M. Barnhard Eldershaw's cult classic Tomorrow and Tomorrow, _Offshore_ constructs a near future that's vivid, terrifying, and eerily feasible.' ‐ Shaun Prescott, author of _The Town_.

> 'Mostafa shows how you, me, anyone, could find themself in this situation...This is a book that shines a light on dark things that are already happening – not just in Australia’s treatment of refugees, but in attitudes that always lurk beneath society’s surface.' - Elizabeth Flux, _Kill Your Darlings_.
