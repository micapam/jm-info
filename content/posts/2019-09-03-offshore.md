In the near future, Sydney is collapsing into chaos. The internet disappears, the water isn't running and the electricity goes out. An academic and a medical student try to smuggle themselves out of the country. But when their boat gets stopped, they are interned on an island detention centre somewhere in the Indian Ocean...

> 'One of the reasons Joshua’s scenes are so compelling is that they could be set today, right now, and that they are set in the world – the Sydney, and the Blue Mountains – that we know....The way Joshua paces and interweaves these narratives, uses them to maintain suspense – the erotics of this text, if you like – is close to masterful.' - David Brooks, author of _The Fern Tattoo_ and _The Grass Library_.

> 'In the vein of M. Barnhard Eldershaw's cult classic Tomorrow and Tomorrow, _Offshore_ constructs a near future that's vivid, terrifying, and eerily feasible.' ‐ Shaun Prescott, author of _The Town_.

Links to buy the book at other shops, including online retailers, can be found on the website of Brio's distributor, Hardie Grant Publishing, at [the relevant page](https://www.hardiegrant.com/au/publishing/bookfinder/book/viva-la-novella-vii-winner-book-2-by-joshua-mostafa/9781925589894).

For international readers, it's a bit more tricky at this point. I will update this page with international retailers once available, but in the meantime the best bet is to [search the ISBN](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781925589894): <strong>9781925589894</strong>.
