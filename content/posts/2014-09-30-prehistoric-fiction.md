This month, I’ve been the guest blogger for _Southerly_. I've been travelling through Europe without a laptop, so it’s been tricky getting the posts typed up and sent off at times! But it’s also been a great opportunity to reflect on my trip, which was a research trip for a work of what I’m calling ‘pre-historical’ fiction (apparently, ‘prehistoric fiction’ is the usual term, but that sounds like the fiction itself is prehistoric, which would refer to something entirely different – narratives from pre-literate oral traditions, or something like that – so I’m sticking with my own awkward coinage).

All the posts are up now – here they are:

1. [Historical fiction](http://southerlyjournal.com.au/2014/09/06/mostafa-untitled-historical-fiction-part-i/)
1. [(Pre)historical fiction](http://southerlyjournal.com.au/2014/09/17/prehistorical-fiction/)
1. [Mode, genre and time](http://southerlyjournal.com.au/2014/09/25/mode-genre-and-time/)
1. [Klekkende Høj](http://southerlyjournal.com.au/2014/09/30/klekkende-hoj/)

There is a new issue of _Southerly_ (the journal itself) coming out soon, too. I’ve got a piece in there as well; I’ll link that up once it’s launched.
