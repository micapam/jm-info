    <p>I'm interested in the spaces between things: between prose and poetry,
      idea and narrative, the written and the spoken word.</p>
    <p>Currently a doctoral student at the Writing &amp; Society Research
      Centre, Western Sydney University, I'm researching prehistory in fiction:
      narrative, form and representation.</p>

      it brings to its portrayal of a future Australia consumed by chaos and calamity.'
      - Cameron Woodhead, <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>.</p>
    <p>'One of the reasons Joshua’s scenes are so compelling is that they could
      be set today, right now, and that they are set in the world – the Sydney,
      and the Blue Mountains – that we know....The way Joshua paces and
      interweaves these narratives, uses them to maintain suspense – the
