This is the source code for my personal website, [joshuamostafa.info](http://joshuamostafa.info).

There's nothing particularly fancy about it for the most part, it's a [nanoc](https://nanoc.ws/)-generated static website. 

However, it does use my Zotero data to power the bibliographies section, using
[the zotero gem I wrote](https://github.com/micapam/zotero). See `lib/data_sources/zotero.rb` for details.
