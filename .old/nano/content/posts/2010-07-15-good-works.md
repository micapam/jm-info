Issue 121 of _Island_ magazine is out. Among the essays, stories and poetry is my poem, ‘Good Works’:

> Sometimes her fingers close a nail’s breadth  
> Or tiny cross’s height below her necklace.  
> Awoken by an owl, begins a prayer  
> Then stops, abashed. No one’s there to hear.
>
> A friend suggests she meditate. But it’s  
> Too lonely. Gaudy surrogates (I-ching  
> Or yoga) cannot help. The dethroned fraud  
> Had majesty court jesters can’t replace.
> 
> She writes long letters, puzzling bureaucrats  
> In Lhasa—Myanmar—Stare Kiejkuty  
> To try to soften bars and iron minds  
> With nothing but a hopeful curve of script.
> 
> St Vincent de Paul’s Sunday morning shift  
> Is always hers; she lingers when the others  
> Walk in with the smell of grace on them.  
> She sniffs and exhales like a reformed smoker.
> 
> Today, black-laced, farewells an old friend  
> An awkward goat among the flock. She mourns  
> The warmth of knowing that no effort goes  
> Unseen. All she has is cold good works.
