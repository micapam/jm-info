The sixth issue of _Abraxas_ was launched last Friday (26 September 2014). I was in London that day, so I made it to Treadwell’s bookshop just in time for the copies of the journal to arrive from the Belgian printer, before getting on the plane. It’s a handsome full-sized magazine, beautifully laid out. I’m pleased that my sonnet ‘Hymn to Saraswatī’ is one of the two poems included between its covers.
