I'm presenting a paper today at the [Independent Publishing Conference](http://smallpressnetwork.com.au/independent-publishing-conference/2014conference/).

> The trajectories of the commercial imperative and of cultural production are often opposed, and at best orthogonal. The rise of digital media and discounted online sales threatens to upset their fragile compromise. New approaches must be found to sustain literary publishing. I explore options beyond the market: the subscription model, private circulation, and finally suggest ‘public circulation’ backed by a relationship of patronage and mutual benefit between literary publishers and public libraries.
