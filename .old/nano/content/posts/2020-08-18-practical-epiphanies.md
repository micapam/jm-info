My piece in _Overland_ #238 is '...an attempt to think about the present issueâ€™s theme, "radicalism and radical critique", and to consider the tension between those two terms. My claim is that, too often, the latter is assumed to do the work of the former. There is plenty wrong with the world in general, and with our corner of it in particular, but simply enumerating what is wrong does not redress it.'
